## Approach
My job as a cloud solution architect requires me to constantly learn new technologies, so the discipline of daily study isn't new to me. Neither is software engineering. However, technology is such a broad field with innumerable moving pieces, and it can be difficult to stay focused on one topic. Even while learning the Swift language, I got distracted reading about [John Sundell's Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) and started migrating this blog. While still relevant in terms of using the programming language, my aim isn't to continue mastering web development. I firmly believe in structured learning. For the start of my journey, I did some research into a few courses to help apply structure to my studies.

## Collaboration
